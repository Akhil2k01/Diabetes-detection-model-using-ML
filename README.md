# Diabetes-detection-model-using-ML
This model uses the concepts of Machine Learning, using which it detects the Diabetes probability and calculates the accuracy and ROC curve with plot graph.

Here I used Jupyter Notebook for implementation and Python as a programming language.

Dataset used in this model is available in this repository.
